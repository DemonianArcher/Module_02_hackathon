            <b>Ban Phase:</b> 
                The bans targeted flex picks and comfort champions. Team One removed strong 
                engage/control champions (Annie, Galio) and snowballers (Yi, Renekton). 
                Team Two focused on shutting down scaling duo carries (Xayah, Senna) and dangerous 
                playmakers (Sylas, Wukong, Gnar).
            </p>
            <p>
            <b>Draft overview:</b> <br>
                Team One (Win): Orianna (Mid), Kai’Sa (ADC), Leona (Support), Graves (Jungle), Malphite (Top) <br>
                Team Two (Loss): Viktor (Mid), Jhin (ADC), Thresh (Support), Viego (Jungle), Camille (Top)<br>

                Team One Strategy: Hard engage + AoE wombo combo (Malphite–Orianna–Kai’Sa). <br>
                Team Two Strategy: Pick comp with Thresh hooks and Camille dives, backed by Viktor zone control. <br>
            </p>
            <p>
            <b>Game Flow:</b> <br>
            Early Game (0–12 min): Ironclad led with pressure — Camille secured first blood top, 
            and Viego picked up two kills around Dragon. They secured the first two Drakes uncontested. <br>
            Mid Game (12–22 min): Eclipse held firm, trading objectives for farm. Orianna scaled up, 
            and Kai’Sa quietly caught up in CS despite Jhin’s lane dominance. <br>
            Turning Point (23 min): At the third Dragon, Ironclad tried to force a pick with Thresh. Malphite 
            counter-engaged with a 3-man Unstoppable Force, followed by Orianna’s Shockwave. Eclipse wiped 
            Ironclad 5–1 and claimed Baron. <br>
            Late Game (24–29 min): With Baron buff and superior teamfight scaling, Eclipse pushed through mid. 
            A second wombo combo near inhibitor sealed the game in under 30 minutes. <br>
            </p>
            <p>
            <b>MVP:</b>  <br>
            Orianna from Team One with a KDA of X/X/X <br>
            Her Shockwaves were always a guaranteed hits that shiftd the teamfight to Team One's favor.
            </p>
            <p>
            <b>Closing Thoughts:</b> <br>
            Team One: Drafted for scaling and trusted their execution. Once mid-game hit, their teamfight combo was unstoppable. <br>
            Team Two: Strong early game with good jungle pressure, but overreliance on picks fell apart once teamfights became mandatory. <br>
            Team Two drafted to win lanes and snowball, but Team One late-game teamfight comp out-scaled and out-executed. <br>
